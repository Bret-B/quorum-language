Instructions for making a windows installer:

1. Clean and Build Quorum in Netbeans.
2. Copy the contents of the "dist" folder to this directory and rename it "Quorum." Make sure to remove any unnecessary files (e.g., .quorum files in the root like "Main.quorum")
3. Install NSIS (if not installed already).
5. Right click on the NSIS script and select "Compile NSIS Script."

That should generate the installer.
