Instructions for making a windows installer:

1. Clean and Build Quorum in Netbeans.
2. Copy the contents of the "dist" folder to this directory named "Quorum." 
3. In the Quorum folder, remove any files that are not intended to be in the final release (e.g., .quorum files in the root like "Main.quorum")
3. Install NSIS (if not installed already).
5. Right click on the NSIS script and select "Compile NSIS Script."

You now have a shiny new installer.
