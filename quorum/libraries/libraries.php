<h1>The Quorum Standard Library</h1>
<p>
    While the Quorum programming language is still in its infancy, it already has
    a basic standard library for helper classes, with features including: 
    1) cross-platform text-to-speech and audio playback, 2) container classes (e.g., arrays, lists), 
    3) basic system classes (e.g., consoles, timing), 4) a small library for 
    iCreate robotics, and  5) some basic classes for math and random numbers. We 
    have a significant number of additions planned for the future and plan to 
    expand on this library with each release.

    library classes</a> is available.</p>
