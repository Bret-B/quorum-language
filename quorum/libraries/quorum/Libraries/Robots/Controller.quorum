/*
The Controller class represents the physical Botball. Several functions have 
been created to assist programmers in creating programs that meet the basic 
Botball requirements of having robots wait until the starting lights come on 
and have their programs shut down after a specified amount of time.

Attribute: Example

use Libraries.Robots.Controller
class Main
   action Main
        // Declaraing the Controller
        Controller cruise
        // Controller waits for 5 seconds without performing any operation
        cruise:Wait(5)
   end
end
*/

/*
        This action will kill all the processes and switches off all the motors,
        after the specified time has elapsed. The Controller is shut down after 
        the speicified amount of time has elapsed.

        Attribute: Parameter time is in seconds.

        Attribute: Example
        
        Controller cruise
        cruise:ShutDownIn(3)
        //the controller shuts down after 3 seconds.

        This action makes the controller wait/sleep for the specified amount of
        time. The controller does not perform any operation for this time.  
        
        Attribute: Parameter time is in seconds.

        Attribute: Example
        
        Controller cruise
        cruise:Wait(2)

/*
        This action will make the Controller wait until the sensor connected to 
        the specified port has detected light.

        Attribute: Parameter port is an integer, the port to which the sensor is 
        connected and waiting to see light.

        Attribute: Example
        
        Controller cruise
        cruise:IsLightInPort(5)
        //the controller waits until the sensor connected to the port 5 has detected
        light.

/*
        This action makes the Controller to beep.

        Attribute: Example
