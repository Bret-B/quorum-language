The batch files setToReadOnly and setToReadWrite are used to set file permission
for all library files. setToReadOnly should be performed before release to ensure
library files can not accidentally be modified by the user.

Running Batch files:
    1. Open a terminal
    2. Navigate to ../sodbeans/build/cluster/quorum
    3. Execute the bash (eg. bash setToReadOnly )

This sets all of the libraries to read only. As new libraries are added this bash
will need to be updated.
