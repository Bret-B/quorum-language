<h1>Lab 1.1: Tutorials</h1>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
After completing this lab, the students will understand the following concepts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the tutorial system in Sodbeans</li>
<li>Navigating the Sodbeans environment</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The goal of this lab is to become familiar with the Sodbeans integrated development environment (IDE), before jumping into the Quorum programming language. This lab will guide us through the tutorial and navigation systems, as well as give us an understanding of projects and files and how they work in the IDE. It is important to understand how to use the tutorials that are provided with Sodbeans, navigate around the environment, and work with projects and files.
</p>
<h2>Task 1: Using the Tutorial System</h2>
<p>
The tutorial system in Sodbeans is a tool that provides a basic understanding of the Sodbeans development environment and the basics of the Quorum programming language.  We will begin by first opening the Sodbeans program.  Open the Sodbeans program. After some waiting, the main Sodbeans window will appear. When Sodbeans has been loaded successfully, the first thing to notice is the Sodbeans 3.0 Tutorials window.
</p>
<p>
The tutorial window consists of six different options to choose from.  The six choices are:  1) Hotkeys Reference, 2) Sodbeans Tutorials, 3) Quorum Tutorials, 4) Quorum Standard Library, 5) Navigation Tutorial, and 6) Close Tutorials Window.  Use the keyboard to press any numbers from one to six or click on the one of six buttons to make a selection. For this lab, we will visit the Hotkeys Reference and Sodbeans Tutorials.
</p>
<p>
First, let's visit the Hotkeys Reference to get a general overview of the hotkeys one might use in Sodbeans.  Press 1 on the keyboard, or click on the button labeled ![1], to enter the Hotkeys Reference window.  This window displays a list of every hotkey, along with the action that they perform. This reference is helfpul, as there is no need to memorize every hotkey to complete a task. Over time, commonly used hotkeys will be easily memorized and help us work more efficiently. Take a look through the list and write down or type the keyboard shortcuts, along with the description for each shortcut listed below.

<p>
Now, let's return to the main tutorial window. Take a quick tour of the other tutorial options on the main tutorial window. Although we are only focusing on the Hotkeys Reference and Sodbeans Tutorials in this lab, we will take a quick look at the other tutorial options to get a feel of the tutorial system in Sodbeans. First, press the 2 key on the keyboard, or click on the ![2] button, to enter the Sodbeans Tutorials. Try navigating the window that appears. Notice that within the Sodbeans Tutorial window, there are many options, such as &quot;Windows and Navigation.&quot; Return to the main tutorial window and repeat the same steps for the &quot;Quorum Tutorials&quot; and &quot;Quorum Standard Library&quot; buttons. After a quick tour, return to the main tutorial window to get ready for the next task.
</p>
<p>
Create a word document with answers for the following questions:
</p>
<ol>
 1. What is the definition of hotkeys?
</ol>
 2. What are some hotkeys that might be the most frequently used?  Include both description and hot key.
 3. What does the tutorial system in Sodbeans offer?
<h2>Task 2: Following Tutorials</h2>
<p>
Itâ€™s time to become familiar with the basics of Sodbeans by learning windows, navigation, projects, and files.  We will work through two tutorials: 1) Windows and Navigation and 2) Projects and Files.
</p>
<p>
Click on the &quot;Sodbeans Tutorials&quot; button and select the &quot;Windows and Navigation&quot; button. Follow the instructions in the tutorial. When the tutorial starts, a new window, called the Tutorial Remote, will appear in the bottom of Sodbeans. If this window doesn't show, select the &quot;Tutorial Remote&quot; tab in the bottom pane of Sodbeans. To navigate between buttons and text boxes in the tutorial window, use the TAB keyboard shortcut.  At the end of the tutorial, press Enter to return to the Sodbeans Tutorials window.
</p>
<p>
In the Sodbeans Tutorials window, go to Projects and Files and follow the instructions in the tutorial.  This tutorial demonstrates how to work with projects and files such as creating, opening, and closing the project.
</p>
<p>
Return to the main tutorial window and close the main tutorial window.
</p>
<p>
To reopen the main tutorial window, go the Help menu and select the Sodbeans Tutorial item.  Close the main tutorial window again.  If there is enough time, play with the keyboard shortcuts, as shown in the tables below.
