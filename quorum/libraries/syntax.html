        <h1>The Syntax of Quorum</h1>
        <p>
            On this page, we describe the syntax, what a programmer actually types,
            to make Quorum programs execute. We focus our attention on the core language features,
            namely 1) creating and using variables, 2) control structures, 3) 
            classes and actions, and 4) libraries and extensions. 
            
            
        </p>
        <h3>Variables and Types</h3>
        <p>
            It is often helpful to be able to tell the computer to remember 
            information while it executes a computer program. For example, 
            you might ask the computer to remember how many dollars are in a 
            bank account or grades on an exam. In this section, we discuss the 
            various ways of storing data in the Quorum programming language.

            <li><a href="casting.html">Type Casting</a>: Convert one type of thing to another.</li>
            <li><a href="comments.html">Comments</a>: Writing notes to yourself 
                (or others) to help understand the code.</li>
            <li><a href="arrays.html">Arrays</a>: Storing collections of data in memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Control Structures</h3>
        <p>
            Often times we want to control how the computer processes information. 
            For example, we might want the computer to do one operation if a 
            variable is greater than 10 and another if it is less then 10. Or, 
            we might want the computer to take the same steps repeatedly. 
            Together, these ideas are called control structures. In this section, 
            we talk about the control structures that are available in the 
            Quorum language.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="repeat.html">Repeat</a>: Doing things zero or more times</li>
            <li><a href="if.html">If</a>: Do something only when a condition 
                is true</li>            
        </ul>
        <h3>Classes and Actions</h3>
        <p>
            As computer programs become larger, it often helps to organize 
            computer code in a variety of ways. Probably the two most common 
            ways to organize code are to use structures that hold a collection 
            of data (called &quot;classes&quot; in Quorum), and a way for code 
            to take a certain behavior (called &quot;actions&quot; in Quorum). 
            Below are links to how these organizational mechanisms are used in 
            the Quorum Programming Language:

                types in container classes.</li>

                deal with errors (called exceptions in other languages).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Libraries and Extensions</h3>
        <p>
            As Quorum is a new programming language, we are still building the
            standard library. In this section, we discuss this library, how you
            add to it, and general recommended coding standards.
