/*
    This class is a behavior for the Scene Editor that moves the camera forward 
    or backward. For cameras in 3D space forward is defined as the direction the 
    camera is facing. The direction of the camera is set using SetDirection and 
    direction can be -1, 0, or 1. A negative number will move the camera backward, 
    0 will not move the camera, and 1 will move the camera forward.
