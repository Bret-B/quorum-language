/*
    This behavior is used to confirm placing an item in a scene using the scene 
    editor. Users can add previews to a scene through a scene palette and if the 
    preview is in a spot where they would like to place it then they can confirm 
    it. Confirming a preview will replace the preview with a full item in the 
    scene that will stay in the scene if focus is moved away or if the scene is 
    saved and closed. This behavior is the main way a user will add to a scene.
