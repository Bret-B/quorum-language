/*
    This class provides a way to compare two chart points objects. The returned values from 
    its sole action is an integer with the value of -1 (the left item is smaller), 
    0 (the items are equal) or 1 (the left item is larger). It can be used to 
    override the standard comparison in Object for sorting chart points to create an even line.
