/*
    This class is used internally by Forms and its related classes to store requests
    to load graphical assets. Because it isn't possible to load graphical resources
    before the game has started, attempts to load images in a Form must be stored
    and resolved later.
    
    This class is for internal use, and most users will never need to interact with it directly.
