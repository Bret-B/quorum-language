/*
This class is used to manage a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. This class is for a client connecting
to a server. There are actions to open or close a TCP connection and send or receive data. Note that this class blocks
when reading data and will block until data has been read. 

Attribute: Example

use Libraries.Network.SocketConnection

SocketConnection con
con:Open("time.nist.gov", 13)
//The server sends a linefeed first so read it first
con:Read(1)
// outputs the current time sent from server
output con:ReadLine()
