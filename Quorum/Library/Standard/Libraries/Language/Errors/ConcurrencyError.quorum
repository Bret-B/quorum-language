/*
The ConcurrencyError class is an error or exception that is thrown when code
attempts to access resources that the current thread is not allowed to use.

Attribute: Example

use Libraries.Game.Game
use Libraries.Game.Graphics.Drawable
use Libraries.Language.Errors.ConcurrencyError

class Main is Game
   action Main
      StartGame()
   end

    action CreateGame
        check
            // Adding an item to the game on the wrong thread will cause an error.
            // This can't typically happen in CreateGame, but more complex programs
            // might otherwise add or manipulate objects in a different thread.
            Drawable box
            box:LoadFilledRectangle(100, 100)
            Add(box)
        detect e is ConcurrencyError
            output "Error detected: " + e:GetErrorMessage()
        end
