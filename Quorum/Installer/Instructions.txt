These instructions say how to build the installer for the Quorum compiler on windows.

1. Bootstrap the compiler. Make sure that a folder appears labeled "Quorum" which should contain
   Quorum.jar, the compiled standard library, and the Library folder.

2. If you haven't already, download NSIS from the download page: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download

3. Because the Quorum compiler uses path adjustment, you need to then override this installation with a special
   build of NSIS for long paths (e.g., dev machines). It is at the bottom of the special builds page (Large Strings Build): https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Special_Builds

4. Install the build by overriding the files in the NSIS installation, probably someplace like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS

5. Download EnvVarUpdate.nsh as a 7z file from here: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/mediawiki/images/a/ad/EnvVarUpdate.7z

6. If you don't have one, install a 7z extractor: https://www.7-zip.org/

7. Extract the file (e.g., right click on the 7z file and select a place to extract it).

8. Place the file you extracted into the include directory of NSIS, usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\Include. A version of this file is placed in the 
   Installer folder for convenience. 

9. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the installer folder of Quorum, usually here in the repository, usually quorum-language\Quorum\Installer

10. Open the file and change any settings that are appropriate, but usually at least the version number (e.g., !define VERSION "7.0.5")

11. Right click on the Installer.nsi file and select Compile NSIS script. Let it finish.

You should now have an installer file for the Quorum Console Compiler.
