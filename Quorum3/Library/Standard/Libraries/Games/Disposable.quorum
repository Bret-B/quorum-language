// Many classes inherit from the Disposable class. If they do, this indicates
// that they are supposed to be disposed of after usage, using the Dispose()
// action. This keeps them from using memory after they are no longer useful.
//
// Note that Dispose() is a blueprint action. This means that any class that
// inherits from Disposable will have to have an implementation of the action.
