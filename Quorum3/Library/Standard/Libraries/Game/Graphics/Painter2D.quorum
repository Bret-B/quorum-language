/*
The Painter2D class is used to draw Drawable objects on the screen. The Game class
provides a default Painter2D, which is passed to Items and Drawables via their
Draw action. It is highly recommended to use that Painter2D when using the Game
class. 

Note that when using the Game class, in most cases it is not necessary to ever 
use the Painter2D class manually, as the Game class will automatically draw
Drawables that have been added to it.
