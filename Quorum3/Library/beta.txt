Quorum 3.0 Beta 2:

This is the second beta test file for the Quorum 3.0 compiler. Given that this is a 
public beta, there are several features the team is still working on. Here is a 
list of known issues.

1. The -web flag, the flag that asks Quorum to generate a .war file,
has not been tested for the beta. We plan to finish this up for the final release.

2. Several minor issues exist in the bug database.

3. There is a slight delay in the tree navigator before it pops up for the first time. After
it syncs up and indexes, it should respond quickly.

4. Code completion is not yet finished in the IDE.

5. Accessibility support is not finished yet, as are doing a new comparison of 
stock NetBeans out-of-the-box on various screen readers. Once this is complete,
we plan to make some tweaks and decisions regarding self voicing options or other
features.

6. While relatively rare, in some instances Quorum 3 is outputting more compiler
errors than it should, or otherwise errors that are less helpful than they 
should be. Users that find compiler errors they consider particularly unhelpful
should file a bug report with a reproducible example.

As always, given that this is a beta compiler, users that find any issues at all 
should feel free to file a bug report. As we go through this process, we will be paying
attention to the database looking for anything users report is not working
as expected.
