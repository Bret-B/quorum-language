Instructions for making a windows installer:

1. Create Zip distribution of the latest source in NetBeans.
2. Unzip the zip distribution. Make sure that Sodbeans is the root folder (not Sodbeans/Sodbeans).
3. Put the unzipped folder in the same folder as the NSIS script.
4. Install NSIS (if not installed already).
5. Right click on the NSIS script and select "Compile NSIS Script."

That should generate the installer.
