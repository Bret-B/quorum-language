To build the C plugins for Windows, open the visual studio project located at:

WindowsCPlugins\builds\windows\vc2010\freetype.sln

You may need to retarget the solution for a more modern Visual Studio installation, and you may need to adjust the linker properties
to point the project to look for additional header files/directories at the correct location for your "jni.h" (located within the JDK).

The output of the project is located in one of the folders in:

WindowsCPlugins\objs\vc2010

Which folder you should look at depends on what build you were targeting. The file you need is "libGameEngineCPlugins32.dll" or "libGameEngineCPlugins64.dll"
Make sure you produce both the 32 and 64 bit .dlls for Quorum!
